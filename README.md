#  OTP-generation-Python Project
# Overview
This project implements an OTP (One-Time Password) verification system using Python. It incorporates GUI functionality with Tkinter, email handling with smtplib, and random OTP generation. Users can input their name and email address, receive an OTP via email, and then verify the OTP through the GUI. Features

1. Email Validation: Validates the email address format to ensure it contains valid domains and extensions.

2. OTP Generation: Generates a random 6-digit OTP using Python's random module.

3. Email Sending: Sends the OTP to the user’s email address using Gmail’s SMTP server.

4. GUI Interface: A user-friendly interface built with Tkinter for
<li>Inputting name and email</li>
<li>Sending the OTP</li>
<li>Entering and verifying the OTP</li>
Error Handling: Validates user input, including email format and numeric OTP. Displays error or success messages using Tkinter's messagebox. Project Structure

# The project has the following components:
1. Email Verification: Ensures the email entered has a valid format.

2. OTP Generation and Sending: Generates a random 6-digit OTP and sends it via Gmail SMTP.

3. OTP Verification: Compares the user-entered OTP with the generated OTP.

4. Graphical User Interface (GUI): Uses Tkinter to create an intuitive interface for users.

# Required Libraries
1. Tkinter: For GUI development.

2. random: To generate the random OTP.

3. smtplib: To handle email communication.

4. messagebox: For GUI-based feedback to users.

# Prerequisites
1. Python: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

2. Email Setup: A Gmail account is required to send OTP emails. Enable 'Allow Less Secure Apps' or generate an App Password.
# How to Run
Run the script.
Follow these steps in the GUI:
<li>Enter your name</li>
<li>Enter your valid email address</li>
<li>Click 'Send OTP' to receive the OTP</li>
<li>Enter the OTP sent to your email</li>
<li>Click 'Verify OTP' to validate it</li>
  
# Workflow
1. Email and OTP Validation: User enters their email. If invalid, an error message is displayed.
2. OTP Sending: A unique OTP is generated and sent to the user's email.
3. OTP Verification: The user enters the received OTP. If correct, a success message is displayed. Otherwise, prompts to retry.
Example Use Case

1. Name: Kumar

2. Email: kumar.d@gmail.com

3. OTP Received: 123456

4. Entered OTP: 123456

5. Output: 'OTP verified successfully!

# Error Handling
1. Invalid Email Format: Displays 'Invalid email format!' if the entered email does not meet criteria.

2. Empty Fields: Displays 'Name cannot be empty!' or other appropriate messages.

3. Non-numeric OTP: Displays 'OTP must be numeric!'.

4. Incorrect OTP: Displays 'Invalid OTP! Please try again.'

# Security Considerations
1. Replace plaintext email passwords with a secure App Password.
2. Avoid hardcoding sensitive data; use environment variables or configuration files.

# Further Enhancements
1. Timer for OTP Verification: Add a timer to set a validity period for the OTP (e.g., 5 minutes). If the OTP is not verified within this timeframe, it should expire, and the user should be prompted to request a new OTP.

2. Multiple Attempts for OTP Verification: Allow users a limited number of attempts (e.g., 3) to enter the correct OTP before invalidating it and requiring a new one to be sent.

# Conclusion 
This project provides a practical example of integrating Python with email services and GUI development to create an OTP-based verification system. It demonstrates Python's versatility and its application in real-world scenarios.
